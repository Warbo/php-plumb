= Plumb =

Plumb is a domain-specific language for defining functions, embedded in PHP.

== Syntax ==

Arrays are function abstractions.

(Natural) numbers are de Bruijn indices.

Commas denote (curried) function application, associating to the left.

__(underscored parentheses) are for overriding the precedence of commas.

All other constructs are treated as their PHP values.

== Usage ==

Write your Plumb straight in your PHP; there's no need to wrap it in quotes or
anything.

To turn a Plumb definition into a PHP function, pass it to the `plumb` function.
